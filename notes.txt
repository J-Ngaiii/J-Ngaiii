# _config
Master file for setting site wide settings like URL, theme, etc

# _sass
Folder for setting appearance of the website. 
- Set custom themes (by creating different `.scss` files)
- Customize layout (by adjusting `base.scss`, `_navigation.scss`, `_sidebar.scss`)
- Use mixins and variables to avoid repeat code (via `_mixins.scss`)

# _layouts
Folder with html templates for setting the structure/layout of different pages of your website. These are liquid templates that dynamically pull content from other folders and styles from _sass. Jekyll applies these layouts dynamically to keep things updated. 
- `compress.html` is a jekyll layout that compresses html
- `default.html` defines the default page structure
- other pages use `default` as their layout

# _includes
Folder for storing reuseable html scripts that can be inserted into different pages using `{% include %}`. 
- Stores header and footer components
- Does SEO and Metadata through files like `head.html`

# _pages
Contains all the templates like `Teaching.html`, `Projects.html` and more that define the layout and permalink of those pages. In the body of files like `Projects.html` you loop through the `_projects` folder

# sidebar.html for configuringn sidebar profile pic
- The line: `<img src= {% if s.image contains "://" %} "{{ s.image }}"` first checks if the image is from a website and loads it from a website --> update `s.image` to be the website url
- The line: `{% else %} "{{ s.image | prepend: "/images/" | prepend: base_path }}"` then constructs a local path to an `/images/` folder

- Change _config.yml > Profile > avatar
- Can also change _data > authors.yml but that doesn't seem to change anything visible 

# Changing the Front Page
- go to _pages > about.md

# Changing the top navigation bar
- go to _data > navigation.yml and also modify _config > collections
