Hi! I’m Jonathan, a third-year studying Political Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley. 

I’m interested in asking data-centric questions and creative problem solving. In particular I’m interested in predictive modeling, probability theory and exploratory data analysis. 

Outside of courses, I’ve been involved in research groups, course staff, student government and community service throughout my time at Berkeley. Through these experiences I’ve developed passions for teaching, research and project management.
