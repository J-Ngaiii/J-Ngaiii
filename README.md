Hi! I’m Jonathan, a third-year studying Political Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley. 

My interest are in ML and Data Science, particularly LLMs, agentic AI, deep learning and exploratory data analysis! 

Outside of courses, I’ve been involved in research groups, course staff, student government and community service orgs throughout my time at Berkeley. I love teaching and service roles where I can apply my skills to have an impact on the communities around me.
