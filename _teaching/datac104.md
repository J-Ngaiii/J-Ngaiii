I served as a reader for the primary ethics course for Data Science Majors at UC Berkeley during the Fall 2024 semester.

## What is DATAC104?
Data C104 is the primary ethics class for undergraduate Data Science majors at UC Berkeley. It's a class that (in my experience) involves concepts and tools from history, political science, political theory, moral philosophy and sociology applied to all things data science (data science technologies, governance systems that use data, working in the tech industry and more). The aim is to teach students how to use different tools from different social science fields to think about the human and moral implications of different technologies and their applications.

## My Role
As a reader, my responsibilities were primarily to work with a grading team to grade weekly assignments and midterms. I graded over 600 weekly assignments submitted by students across 2 sections over 15 weeks. I also graded a midterm and a final exam which totaled up to around 400+ exams graded. 

I also helped host office hours to help students who were struggling in the class, had questions about the assignments/exams or were curious about how the course was structured and did grading.
