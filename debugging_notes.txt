# Ruby Permission Issue for installing jekyll
Indicator: Local path is “usr/bin/ruby” rather than “usr/local/bin/ruby”
Fix: Install ruby version manager
- brew install rbenv
- rbenv init
- rbenv install 3.1.2
- rbenv global 3.1.2
- Restrat terminal
- rbenv init
- rbenv global 3.1.2
- Which ruby → check that its something like “/Users/jonathanngai/.rbenv/shims/ruby”

- Then do gem install jekyll 

# Getting Projects Page Working
- Check that theres a `_projects` folder with a `project-1.md`
- Check that the `_config.yml` has a section called `collections` with:
    `
    projects:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:path/
    `
- Check that navigation.yml has the following under `main`:
    `
    - title: "Projects"
    url: /projects/
    `
- in `_pages` or root of repo have a `projects.html` that defines how projects are formatted
- Individual projects.md have a `layout: projects`

# Doubled sidebar and pages across every page
- Issue with comments in `_layouts` > `default.html`
